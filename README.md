# Hello, I'm Nelson Genao

###  I'm a Data Scientist and graduate of Flatiron School.
I have a diverse background in education, medical claims, accounting, and property management over the past 10 years.  I enjoy creative problem solving and finding ways to 
increase process efficiency.  Ultimately, I aim to help others using my experience and skillsets.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a YouTube analytics project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently brushing up on statistical concepts.
- ðŸŽ® I love playing video games with my friends, and learning guitar in my free time.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned to produce flute sounds using just my hands, albeit poorly.
